# 👋 Welcome to Your First Commit!

This file is part of the **Module 7: Pre-Class Lab Prep: Introduction to GitHub and Codespaces** activity.
You'll use it to practice editing a file, saving your work, and committing changes to the repository.

## Your Task
1. Add a new line below that says something like:

Hello from First_Name Last_Name! Today is November x, 2025.

2. Save the file.
3. Commit and push your changes using the **Source Control** panel in VS Code (the “branch” icon on the left).

> 💡 Tip: Each commit creates a snapshot of your work. Pushing sends those changes to GitHub so others can see them.

## Markdown Basics
Markdown is a lightweight formatting language used on GitHub for README files, documentation, and more. You can learn more about basic syntax here:

👉 [**Markdown Guide – Basic Syntax**](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Try adding a few simple Markdown elements:
- `#` for headings
- `**bold**` or `*italic*` for emphasis
- `-` for bullet lists
- `` `code` `` for inline code
